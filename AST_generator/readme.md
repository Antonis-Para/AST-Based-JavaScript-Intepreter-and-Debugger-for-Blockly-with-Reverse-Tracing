# JSON Types of blocks generated

All blocks have an *id* field. If the block is generated by default (block doesn't exist)
then the id will be *null*

## Statements
- stmts
    + Has a `data [{}, {}, ...]` tag that can contain any of the other types.
- if_stmt
    + Has a `cond` : any type leading to bool (condition of the if)
    + Has a `do` : `stmts` (if cond true, do will be executed)
- while_stmt
    + Has a `cond` : any type leading to bool (condition of the if)
    + Has a `do` : `stmts` (if cond is true, do will be executed)
- for_stmt
    + Has a `var_name` : var type (must be a variable. i.e "i")
    + Has a `from` : any type leading to number (where the for starts from)
    + Has a `to` : any type leading to number (where the for ends)  
    + Has a `by` : any type leading to number (step),  
    + Has a `do` : `stmts` (if cond is true, do will be executed)
- forEach_stmt
    + Has a `var_name` : var type (must be a variable. i.e "i")
    + Has an `in` : list type (the list we are about to go through)
    + Has a `do` : `stmts` (if cond is true, do will be executed)
- repeat_stmt
    + Has a `cond` : any type leading to number (a number specifying how many times it will execute)  
    + Has a `do` : `stmts` (if cond is true, do will be executed)

    + Has a `value`
- keyword
    + Has a `name` (i.e "return")
    + *Might* have a `value`. (i.e. return 1; has a value of 1)
     
## Expresions
- logic_expr
    + Has an `op` : (and, or, eq, neq, lt, lte, gt, gte)
    + Has a `lval` : any type
    + Has a `rval` : any type
- tenary_expr

- var
    + Has a `name` : (string with the variable's name)
- var_change
    + Has a `var_name` : (string with the variable's name)
    + Has a `value` : any type (variable's new value)
    
## Functions
- func_call
    + Has a `name` : (string with the function's name i.e. "Math.sqrt")
    + Has `args[]` : any type (the arguments of the function)
- func_decl
    + Has `args[]` : array of text (the argument names of the function)
    + Has a `name` : (string with the function's name i.e. "NewFunction")
    + Has a `do` : `stmts` (what will be executed when the func is called)
- userfunc_call
    + Has `args[]` : array of any types (the arguments passed)
    + Has a `name` : (string with the function's name i.e. "NewFunction")

    + Has a `name` : (string with the function's name i.e. "NewFunction")
    + Has a `param`: (Will be used to specify a special case of a libfunc i.e get\_from\_start)
        * If the param is equal to sort, a direction and a sort type will be used as well

## Properties
- property
    + Has a `name` : (i.e. ".length")
    + Has an `item` : text (the 'name' will be performed on this item)
